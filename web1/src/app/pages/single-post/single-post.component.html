          <h1>HOW TO START A BLOG IN 2020 EDITED NEW CATEGORY</h1>
          <p>
            Blogging has been around for years – and changed considerably in the
            process: they started out as sort of online journals for anyone who
            wanted to express themselves online, now they’re full-fledged
            businesses in their own right that can generate huge amounts of
            revenue (in fact, some of the biggest blogs in the world make over
            $1,000,000 a month – and yup, you’ve read that right). And because
            of that, people want to get into blogging for various reasons – and
            not just because they want to express their views to a wider
            audience. In my experience, there are 2 main reasons why someone
            would want to start a blog: As a hobby, to help share your knowledge
            and skills and build an audience online To make money: i.e. to build
            a business out of a blog, either to make some side money every month
            or to turn it into a full-time job – one that can make you a LOT
            more money than a regular job (even upwards of $50k per month!) As
            for businesses, blogging presents an amazing opportunity to promote
            and grow your business: It helps you reach a wider audience and
            boost your brand’s awareness It helps you generate more targeted
            traffic to your website It helps you generate more leads and
            conversions And ultimately, it helps you reach the ultimate
            objective that most businesses have: to make more sales. So, whether
            you’re a business or an individual who wants to start a blog, either
            as a passion project or as a means to boost your income, this is the
            guide for you.
